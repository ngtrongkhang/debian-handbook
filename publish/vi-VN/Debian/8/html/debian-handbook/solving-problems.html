		For an administrator, the most important skill is to be able to cope with any situation, known or unknown. This chapter gives a number of methods that will — hopefully — allow you to isolate the cause of any problem that you will encounter, so that you may be able to resolve them.

			Before you can understand what is really going on when there is a problem, you need to know the theoretical role played by each program involved in the problem. To do this, the best reflex to have is consult their documentation; but since these documentations are many and can be scattered far and wide, you should know all the places where they can be found.

			 <a id="id-1.10.4.4.2" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <a id="id-1.10.4.4.3" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <a id="id-1.10.4.4.4" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>CULTURE</em></span> <abbr class="acronym">RTFM</abbr></strong></p></div></div></div> 
			 <a id="id-1.10.4.4.5.2" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <p>
				This acronym stands for “Read the F***ing Manual”, but can also be expanded in a friendlier variant, “Read the Fine Manual”. This phrase is sometimes used in (terse) responses to questions from newbies. It is rather abrupt, and betrays a certain annoyance at a question asked by someone who has not even bothered to read the documentation. Some say that this classic response is better than no response at all (since it indicates that the documentation contains the information sought), or than a more verbose and angry answer.
			</p>
			 <p>
				In any case, if someone responds “RTFM” to you, it is often wise not to take offense. Since this answer may be perceived as vexing, you might want to try and avoid receiving it. If the information that you need is not in the manual, which can happen, you might want to say so, preferably in your initial question. You should also describe the various steps that you have personally taken to find information before you raised a question on a forum. Following Eric Raymond's guidelines is a good way to avoid the most common mistakes and get useful answers. <a class="ulink" href="http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html</a>
			</p>
			 </div> <p>
				Manual pages, while relatively terse in style, contain a great deal of essential information. We will quickly go over the command for viewing them. Simply type <span class="command"><strong>man <em class="replaceable">manual-page</em></strong></span> — the manual page usually goes by the same name as the command whose documentation is sought. For example, to learn about the possible options for the <span class="command"><strong>cp</strong></span> command, you would type the <span class="command"><strong>man cp</strong></span> command at the shell prompt (see sidebar <a class="xref" href="solving-problems.html#sidebar.shell" title="BACK TO BASICS The shell, a command line interpreter"><span class="emphasis"><em>BACK TO BASICS</em></span> The shell, a command line interpreter</a>).
			</p>
			 <div class="sidebar" id="sidebar.shell"><a xmlns="" id="sidebar.shell"/><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>BACK TO BASICS</em></span> The shell, a command line interpreter</strong></p></div></div></div> 
			 <a id="id-1.10.4.4.7.2" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <a id="id-1.10.4.4.7.3" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <p>
				A command line interpreter, also called a “shell”, is a program that executes commands that are either entered by the user or stored in a script. In interactive mode, it displays a prompt (usually ending in <code class="literal">$</code> for a normal user, or by <code class="literal">#</code> for an administrator) indicating that it is ready to read a new command. <a class="xref" href="short-remedial-course.html" title="Phụ lục B. Khoá bổ sung ngắn hạn">Phụ lục B, <em>Khoá bổ sung ngắn hạn</em></a> describes the basics of using the shell.
			</p>
			 <p>
				The default and most commonly used shell is <span class="command"><strong>bash</strong></span> (Bourne Again SHell), but there are others, including <span class="command"><strong>dash</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>csh</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>tcsh</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>zsh</strong></span>.
			</p>
			 <p>
				Among other things, most shells offer help during input at the prompt, such as the completion of command or file names (which you can generally activate by pressing the <span class="keycap"><strong>tab</strong></span> key), or recalling previous commands (history management).
			</p>
			 </div> <p>
				Man pages not only document programs accessible from the command line, but also configuration files, system calls, C library functions, and so forth. Sometimes names can collide. For example, the shell's <span class="command"><strong>read</strong></span> command has the same name as the <code class="function">read</code> system call. This is why manual pages are organized in numbered sections:
			</p>
			 <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
					<p>
						commands that can be executed from the command line;
					</p>

				</li><li class="listitem">
					<p>
						system calls (functions provided by the kernel);
					</p>

				</li><li class="listitem">
					<p>
						library functions (provided by system libraries);
					</p>

				</li><li class="listitem">
					<p>
						devices (on Unix-like systems, these are special files, usually placed in the <code class="filename">/dev/</code> directory);
					</p>

				</li><li class="listitem">
					<p>
						configuration files (formats and conventions);
					</p>

				</li><li class="listitem">
					<p>
						games;
					</p>

				</li><li class="listitem">
					<p>
						sets of macros and standards;
					</p>

				</li><li class="listitem">
					<p>
						system administration commands;
					</p>

				</li><li class="listitem">
					<p>
						kernel routines.
					</p>

				</li></ol></div>
			 <p>
				It is possible to specify the section of the manual page that you are looking for: to view the documentation for the <code class="function">read</code> system call, you would type <span class="command"><strong>man 2 read</strong></span>. When no section is explicitly specified, the first section that has a manual page with the requested name will be shown. Thus, <span class="command"><strong>man shadow</strong></span> returns <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">shadow</span>
				(5)</span> because there are no manual pages for <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">shadow</em></span> in sections 1 to 4.
			</p>
			 <div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>TIP</em></span> <span class="command"><strong>whatis</strong></span></strong></p></div></div></div> 
			 <a id="id-1.10.4.4.11.2" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <p>
				If you do not want to look at the full manual page, but only a short description to confirm that it is what you are looking for, simply enter <span class="command"><strong>whatis <em class="replaceable">command</em></strong></span>.
			</p>
			 
<pre class="screen">
<code class="computeroutput">$ </code><strong class="userinput"><code>whatis scp</code></strong>
<code class="computeroutput">scp (1) - secure copy (remote file copy program)</code></pre>
			 <p>
				This short description is included in the <span class="emphasis"><em>NAME</em></span> section at the beginning of all manual pages.
			</p>
			 </div> <p>
				Of course, if you do not know the names of the commands, the manual is not going to be of much use to you. This is the purpose of the <span class="command"><strong>apropos</strong></span> command, which helps you conduct a search in the manual pages, or more specifically in their short descriptions. Each manual page begins essentially with a one line summary. <span class="command"><strong>apropos</strong></span> returns a list of manual pages whose summary mentions the requested keyword(s). If you choose them well, you will find the name of the command that you need.
			</p>
			 <div class="example" id="id-1.10.4.4.13"><a xmlns="" id="id-1.10.4.4.13"/><p class="title"><strong>Ví dụ 7.1. Finding <span class="command">cp</span> with <span class="command">apropos</span></strong></p><div class="example-contents">
				
				 
<pre class="screen">
<code class="computeroutput">$ </code><strong class="userinput"><code>apropos "copy file"</code></strong>
<code class="computeroutput">cp (1) - copy files and directories cpio (1) - copy files to and from archives gvfs-copy (1) - Copy files gvfs-move (1) - Copy files hcopy (1) - copy files from or to an HFS volume install (1) - copy files and set attributes ntfscp (8) - copy file to an NTFS volume. </code></pre>

			</div></div>
			 <div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>TIP</em></span> Browsing by following links</strong></p></div></div></div> 
			 <p>
				Many manual pages have a “SEE ALSO” section, usually at the end. It refers to other manual pages relevant to similar commands, or to external documentation. In this way, it is possible to find relevant documentation even when the first choice is not optimal.
			</p>
			 </div> <p>
				The <span class="command"><strong>man</strong></span> command is not the only means of consulting the manual pages, since <span class="command"><strong>konqueror</strong></span> (in KDE) and <span class="command"><strong>yelp</strong></span> (under GNOME) programs also offer this possibility. There is also a web interface, provided by the <span class="command"><strong>man2html</strong></span> package, which allows you to view manual pages in a web browser. On a computer where this package is installed, use this URL: <a class="ulink" href="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html">http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html</a>
			</p>
			 <p>
				This utility requires a web server. This is why you should choose to install this package on one of your servers: all users of the local network could benefit from this service (including non-Linux machines), and this will allow you not to set up an HTTP server on each workstation. If your server is also accessible from other networks, it may be desirable to restrict access to this service only to users of the local network.

			 <p>
				Debian requires each program to have a manual page. If the upstream author does not provide one, the Debian package maintainer will usually write a minimal page that will at the very least direct the reader to the location of the original documentation.
			</p>
			 </div>
		</section>
		 <section class="section" id="id-1.10.4.5"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="" id="id-1.10.4.5"/>7.1.2. <span class="emphasis"><em>info</em></span> Documents</h3></div></div></div>
			
			 <a id="id-1.10.4.5.2" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <a id="id-1.10.4.5.3" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <p>
				The GNU project has written manuals for most of its programs in the <span class="emphasis"><em>info</em></span> format; this is why many manual pages refer to the corresponding <span class="emphasis"><em>info</em></span> documentation. This format offers some advantages, but the default program to view these documents (it is called <span class="command"><strong>info</strong></span>) is also slightly more complex. You would be well advised to use <span class="command"><strong>pinfo</strong></span> instead (from the <span class="pkg pkg">pinfo</span> package).
			</p>
			 <a id="id-1.10.4.5.5" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <p>
				The <span class="emphasis"><em>info</em></span> documentation has a hierarchical structure, and if you invoke <span class="command"><strong>pinfo</strong></span> without parameters, it will display a list of the nodes available at the first level. Usually, nodes bear the name of the corresponding commands.
			</p>
			 <p>
				With <span class="command"><strong>pinfo</strong></span> navigating between these nodes is easy to achieve with the arrow keys. Alternatively, you could also use a graphical browser, which is a lot more user-friendly. Again, <span class="command"><strong>konqueror</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>yelp</strong></span> work; the <span class="command"><strong>info2www</strong></span> also provides a web interface. <a class="ulink" href="http://localhost/cgi-bin/info2www">http://localhost/cgi-bin/info2www</a>
			</p>
			 <a id="id-1.10.4.5.8" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <p>
				Note that the <span class="emphasis"><em>info</em></span> system is not suitable for translation, unlike the <span class="command"><strong>man</strong></span> page system. <span class="emphasis"><em>info</em></span> documents are thus almost always in English. However, when you ask the <span class="command"><strong>pinfo</strong></span> program to display a non-existing <span class="emphasis"><em>info</em></span> page, it will fall back on the <span class="emphasis"><em>man</em></span> page by the same name (if it exists), which might be translated.
			</p>

		 <section class="section" id="id-1.10.4.6"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="" id="id-1.10.4.6"/>7.1.3. Specific Documentation</h3></div></div></div>
			
			 <a id="id-1.10.4.6.2" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <p>
				Each package includes its own documentation. Even the least well documented programs generally have a <code class="filename">README</code> file containing some interesting and/or important information. This documentation is installed in the <code class="filename">/usr/share/doc/<em class="replaceable">package</em>/</code> directory (where <em class="replaceable">package</em> represents the name of the package). If the documentation is particularly large, it may not be included in the program's main package, but might be offloaded to a dedicated package which is usually named <code class="literal"><em class="replaceable">package</em>-doc</code>. The main package generally recommends the documentation package so that you can easily find it.
			</p>
			 <a id="id-1.10.4.6.4" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <a id="id-1.10.4.6.5" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <a id="id-1.10.4.6.6" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <p>
				The <code class="filename">/usr/share/doc/<em class="replaceable">package</em>/</code> directory also contains some files provided by Debian which complete the documentation by specifying the package's particularities or improvements compared to a traditional installation of the software. The <code class="filename">README.Debian</code> file also indicates all of the adaptations that were made to comply with the Debian Policy. The <code class="filename">changelog.Debian.gz</code> file allows the user to follow the modifications made to the package over time: it is very useful to try to understand what has changed between two installed versions that do not have the same behavior. Finally, there is sometimes a <code class="filename">NEWS.Debian.gz</code> file which documents the major changes in the program that may directly concern the administrator.

		 <section class="section" id="id-1.10.4.7"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="" id="id-1.10.4.7"/>7.1.4. Websites</h3></div></div></div>
			
			 <p>
				In most cases, free software programs have websites that are used to distribute it and to bring together the community of its developers and users. These sites are frequently loaded with relevant information in various forms: official documentation, FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions), mailing list archives, etc. Problems that you may encounter have often already been the subject of many questions; the FAQ or mailing list archives may have a solution for it. A good mastery of search engines will prove immensely valuable to find relevant pages quickly (by restricting the search to the Internet domain or sub-domain dedicated to the program). If the search returns too many pages or if the results do not match what you seek, you can add the keyword <strong class="userinput"><code>debian</code></strong> to limit results and target relevant information.
			</p>
			 <div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>TIPS</em></span> From error to solution</strong></p></div></div></div> 
			 <p>
				If the software returns a very specific error message, enter it into the search engine (between double quotes, <code class="literal">"</code>, in order to search not for individual keywords, but for the complete phrase). In most cases, the first links returned will contain the answer that you need.
			</p>
			 <p>
				In other cases, you will get very general errors, such as “Permission denied”. In this case, it is best to check the permissions of the elements involved (files, user ID, groups, etc.).
			</p>
			 </div> <p>
				If you do not know the address for the software's website, there are various means of getting it. First, check if there is a <code class="literal">Homepage</code> field in the package's meta-information (<span class="command"><strong>apt-cache show <em class="replaceable">package</em></strong></span>). Alternately, the package description may contain a link to the program's official website. If no URL is indicated, look at <code class="filename">/usr/share/doc/<em class="replaceable">package</em>/copyright</code>. The Debian maintainer generally indicates in this file where they got the program's source code, and this is likely to be the website that you need to find. If at this stage your search is still unfruitful, consult a free software directory, such as FSF's Free Software Directory, or search directly with a search engine, such as Google, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo, etc. <a class="ulink" href="https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Main_Page">https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Main_Page</a>

			 <a id="id-1.10.4.7.6" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <p>
				You might also want to check the Debian wiki, a collaborative website where anybody, even simple visitors, can make suggestions directly from their browsers. It is used equally by developers who design and specify their projects, and by users who share their knowledge by writing documents collaboratively. <a class="ulink" href="http://wiki.debian.org/">http://wiki.debian.org/</a>

		 <section class="section" id="id-1.10.4.8"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="" id="id-1.10.4.8"/>7.1.5. Tutorials (<span class="emphasis"><em>HOWTO</em></span>)</h3></div></div></div>
			
			 <a id="id-1.10.4.8.2" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <p>
				A howto is a document that describes, in concrete terms and step by step, “how to” reach a predefined goal. The covered goals are relatively varied, but often technical in nature: for example, setting up IP Masquerading, configuring software RAID, installing a Samba server, etc. These documents often attempt to cover all of the potential problems likely to occur during the implementation of a given technology.
			</p>
			 <p>
				Many such tutorials are managed by the Linux Documentation Project (LDP), whose website hosts all of these documents: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tldp.org/">http://www.tldp.org/</a>
			</p>
			 <a id="id-1.10.4.8.5" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <a id="id-1.10.4.8.6" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <p>
				These documents should be taken with a grain of salt. They are often several years old; the information they contain is sometimes obsolete. This phenomenon is even more frequent for their translations, since updates are neither systematic nor instant after the publication of a new version of the original documents. This is part of the joys of working in a volunteer environment and without constraints…
