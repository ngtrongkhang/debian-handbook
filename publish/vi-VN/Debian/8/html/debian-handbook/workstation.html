			The initial configuration for the graphical interface can be awkward at times; very recent video cards often don't work perfectly with the X.org version shipped in the Debian stable version.
		</p>
		 <p>
			A brief reminder: X.org is the software component that allows graphical applications to display windows on screen. It includes a driver that makes efficient use of the video card. The features offered to the graphical applications are exported through a standard interface, <span class="emphasis"><em>X11</em></span> (<span class="distribution distribution">Jessie</span> contains version <span class="emphasis"><em>X11R7.7</em></span>).
		</p>
		 <div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>PERSPECTIVE</em></span> X11, XFree86 and X.org</strong></p></div></div></div> 
		 <p>
			X11 is the graphical system most widely used on Unix-like systems (also available for Windows and Mac OS). Strictly speaking, the term “X11” only refers to a protocol specification, but it is also used to refer to the implementation in practice.
		</p>
		 <p>
			X11 had a rough start, but the 1990s saw XFree86 emerge as the reference implementation because it was free software, portable, and maintained by a collaborative community. However, the rate of evolution slowed down near the end when the software only gained new drivers. That situation, along with a very controversial license change, led to the X.org fork in 2004. This is now the reference implementation, and Debian <span class="distribution distribution">Jessie</span> uses X.org version 7.7.
		</p>
		 </div> <p>
			Current versions of X.org are able to autodetect the available hardware: this applies to the video card and the monitor, as well as keyboards and mice; in fact, it is so convenient that the package no longer even creates a <code class="filename">/etc/X11/xorg.conf</code> configuration file. This is all made possible by features provided by the Linux kernel (in particular for keyboards and mice), by having each driver list the video cards it supports, and by using the DDC protocol to fetch monitor characteristics.
		</p>
		 <a id="id-1.16.4.10" class="indexterm"></a>
		 <p>
			The keyboard configuration is currently set up in <code class="filename">/etc/default/keyboard</code>. This file is used both to configure the text console and the graphical interface, and it is handled by the <span class="pkg pkg">keyboard-configuration</span> package. Details on configuring the keyboard layout are available in <a class="xref" href="basic-configuration.html#sect.keyboard-config" title="8.1.2. Cấu hình Bàn phím">Phần 8.1.2, “Cấu hình Bàn phím”</a>.
		</p>
		 <p>
			The <span class="pkg pkg">xserver-xorg-core</span> package provides a generic X server, as used by the 7.x versions of X.org. This server is modular and uses a set of independent drivers to handle the many different kinds of video cards. Installing <span class="pkg pkg">xserver-xorg</span> ensures that both the server and at least one video driver are installed.
		</p>
		 <a id="id-1.16.4.13" class="indexterm"></a>
		 <a id="id-1.16.4.14" class="indexterm"></a>
		 <p>
			Note that if the detected video card is not handled by any of the available drivers, X.org tries using the VESA and fbdev drivers. VESA is a generic driver that should work everywhere, but with limited capabilities (fewer available resolutions, no hardware acceleration for games and visual effects for the desktop, and so on) while fbdev works on top of the kernel's framebuffer device. The X server writes its messages to the <code class="filename">/var/log/Xorg.0.log</code> log file, which is where one would look to know what driver is currently in use. For example, the following snippet matches what the <code class="literal">intel</code> driver outputs when it is loaded:
		</p>
		 
<pre class="programlisting">
(==) Matched intel as autoconfigured driver 0
(==) Matched modesetting as autoconfigured driver 1
(==) Matched vesa as autoconfigured driver 2
(==) Matched fbdev as autoconfigured driver 3
(==) Assigned the driver to the xf86ConfigLayout
(II) LoadModule: "intel"
(II) Loading /usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers/intel_drv.so
</pre>

		 <div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>EXTRA</em></span> Proprietary drivers</strong></p></div></div></div> 
		 <p>
			Some video card makers (most notably nVidia) refuse to publish the hardware specifications that would be required to implement good free drivers. They do, however, provide proprietary drivers that allow using their hardware. This policy is nefarious, because even when the provided driver exists, it is usually not as polished as it should be; more importantly, it does not necessarily follow the X.org updates, which may prevent the latest available driver from loading correctly (or at all). We cannot condone this behavior, and we recommend you avoid these makers and favor more cooperative manufacturers.
		</p>
		 <p>
			If you still end up with such a card, you will find the required packages in the <span class="emphasis"><em>non-free</em></span> section: <span class="pkg pkg">nvidia-glx</span> for nVidia cards, and <span class="pkg pkg">fglrx-driver</span> for some ATI cards. Both cases require matching kernel modules. Building these modules can be automated by installing the packages <span class="pkg pkg">nvidia-kernel-dkms</span> (for nVidia), or <span class="pkg pkg">fglrx-modules-dkms</span> (for ATI).
		</p>
		 <p>
			The “nouveau” project aims to develop a free software driver for nVidia cards. As of <span class="distribution distribution">Jessie</span>, its feature set does not match the proprietary driver. In the developers' defense, we should mention that the required information can only be gathered by reverse engineering, which makes things difficult. The free driver for ATI video cards, called “radeon”, is much better in that regard although it often requires non-free firmware.
