			 <p>
				Once the BIOS has begun booting from the CD- or DVD-ROM, the Isolinux bootloader menu appears. At this stage, the Linux kernel is not yet loaded; this menu allows you to choose the kernel to boot and enter possible parameters to be transferred to it in the process.
			</p>
			 <p>
				For a standard installation, you only need to choose “Install” or “Graphical install” (with the arrow keys), then press the <span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span> key to initiate the remainder of the installation process. If the DVD-ROM is a “Multi-arch” disk, and the machine has an Intel or AMD 64 bit processor, the menu options “64 bit install” and “64 bit graphical install” enable the installation of the 64 bit variant (<span class="emphasis"><em>amd64</em></span>) instead of the default 32 bit variant (<span class="emphasis"><em>i386</em></span>). In practice, the 64 bit version can almost always be used: most recent processors are 64 bit processors and the 64 bit version deals better with the large amount of RAM that new computers tend to have.
			</p>
			 <div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>GOING FURTHER</em></span> 32 or 64 bits?</strong></p></div></div></div>

			 <a id="id-1.7.12.2.4.4" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <p>
				The fundamental difference between 32 and 64 bit systems is the size of memory addresses. In theory, a 32 bit system can not work with more than 4 GB of RAM (2<sup>32</sup> bytes). In practice, it is possible to work around this limitation by using the <code class="literal">686-pae</code> kernel variant, so long as the processor handles the PAE (Physical Address Extension) functionality. Using it does have a notable influence on system performance, however. This is why it is useful to use the 64 bit mode on a server with a large amount of RAM.
			</p>
			 <p>
				For an office computer (where a few percent difference in performance is negligible), you must keep in mind that some proprietary programs are not available in 64 bit versions (such as Skype, for example). It is technically possible to make them work on 64 bit systems, but you have to install the 32 bit versions of all the necessary libraries (see <a class="xref" href="sect.manipulating-packages-with-dpkg.html#sect.multi-arch" title="5.4.5. Hỗ trợ Multi-Arch">Phần 5.4.5, “Hỗ trợ Multi-Arch”</a>), and sometimes to use <span class="command"><strong>setarch</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>linux32</strong></span> (in the <span class="pkg pkg">util-linux</span> package) to trick applications regarding the nature of the system. <a id="id-1.7.12.2.4.6.5" class="indexterm"></a> <a id="id-1.7.12.2.4.6.6" class="indexterm"></a>

			 <a id="id-1.7.12.2.5.2" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <p>
				If the computer is already running Windows, it is not necessary to delete the system in order to install Debian. You can have both systems at once, each installed on a separate disk or partition, and choose which to start when booting the computer. This configuration is often called “dual boot”, and the Debian installation system can set it up. This is done during the hard drive partitioning stage of installation and while setting up the bootloader (see the sidebars <a class="xref" href="sect.installation-steps.html#sidebar.shrinking-partition" title="IN PRACTICE Shrinking a Windows partition"><span class="emphasis"><em>IN PRACTICE</em></span> Shrinking a Windows partition</a> and <a class="xref" href="sect.installation-steps.html#sidebar.bootloader-dual-boot" title="BEWARE Bootloader and dual boot"><span class="emphasis"><em>BEWARE</em></span> Bootloader and dual boot</a>).
			</p>
			 <p>
				If you already have a working Windows system, you can even avoid using a CD-ROM; Debian offers a Windows program that will download a light Debian installer and set it up on the hard disk. You then only need to reboot the computer and choose between normal Windows boot or booting the installation program. You can also find it on a dedicated website with a rather explicit name… <a class="ulink" href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/tools/win32-loader/stable/">http://ftp.debian.org/debian/tools/win32-loader/stable/</a> <a class="ulink" href="http://www.goodbye-microsoft.com/">http://www.goodbye-microsoft.com/</a>

			 <p>
				The bootloader is a low-level program that is responsible for booting the Linux kernel just after the BIOS passes off its control. To handle this task, it must be able to locate the Linux kernel to boot on the disk. On the i386 and amd64 architectures, the two most used programs to perform this task are LILO, the older of the two, and GRUB, its modern replacement. Isolinux and Syslinux are alternatives frequently used to boot from removable media.
			</p>
			 </div> <p>
				Each menu entry hides a specific boot command line, which can be configured as needed by pressing the <span class="keycap"><strong>TAB</strong></span> key before validating the entry and booting. The “Help” menu entry displays the old command line interface, where the <span class="keycap"><strong>F1</strong></span> to <span class="keycap"><strong>F10</strong></span> keys display different help screens detailing the various options available at the prompt. You will rarely need to use this option except in very specific cases.
			</p>
			 <p>
				The “expert” mode (accessible in the “Advanced options” menu) details all possible options in the process of installation, and allows navigation between the various steps without them happening automatically in sequence. Be careful, this very verbose mode can be confusing due to the multitude of configuration choices that it offers.

			</div></div>
			 <p>
				Once booted, the installation program guides you step by step throughout the process. This section presents each of these steps in detail. Here we follow the process of an installation from a Multi-Arch DVD-ROM (more specifically, the beta4 version of the installer for Jessie); <span class="emphasis"><em>netinst</em></span> installations, as well as the final release of the installer, may look slightly different. We will also address installation in graphical mode, but the only difference from “classic” (text-mode) installation is in the visual appearance.

			 <a id="id-1.7.12.3.2" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <p>
				The installation program begins in English, but the first step allows the user to choose the language that will be used in the rest of the process. Choosing French, for example, will provide an installation entirely translated into French (and a system configured in French as a result). This choice is also used to define more relevant default choices in subsequent stages (notably the keyboard layout).

			 <div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>BACK TO BASICS</em></span> Navigating with the keyboard</strong></p></div></div></div> 
			 <p>
				Some steps in the installation process require you to enter information. These screens have several areas that may “have focus” (text entry area, checkboxes, list of choices, OK and Cancel buttons), and the <span class="keycap"><strong>TAB</strong></span> key allows you to move from one to another.
			</p>
			 <p>
				In graphical mode, you can use the mouse as you would normally on an installed graphical desktop.

			 <a id="id-1.7.12.4.2" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <p>
				The second step consists in choosing your country. Combined with the language, this information enables the program to offer the most appropriate keyboard layout. This will also influence the configuration of the time zone. In the United States, a standard QWERTY keyboard is suggested, and a choice of appropriate time zones is offered.

			 <p>
				This step is completely automatic in the vast majority of cases. The installer detects your hardware, and tries to identify the CD-ROM drive used in order to access its content. It loads the modules corresponding to the various hardware components detected, and then “mounts” the CD-ROM in order to read it. The previous steps were completely contained in the boot image included on the CD, a file of limited size and loaded into memory by the BIOS when booting from the CD.
			</p>
			 <p>
				The installer can work with the vast majority of drives, especially standard ATAPI peripherals (sometimes called IDE and EIDE). However, if detection of the CD-ROM reader fails, the installer offers the choice to load a kernel module (for instance from a USB key) corresponding to the CD-ROM driver.
			</p>

			 <p>
				With the contents of the CD now available, the installer loads all the files necessary to continue with its work. This includes additional drivers for the remaining hardware (especially the network card), as well as all the components of the installation program.
			</p>

		</section>
		 <section class="section" id="sect.install-detect-network"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="" id="sect.install-detect-network"/>4.2.7. Detecting Network Hardware</h3></div></div></div>
			
			 <p>
				This automatic step tries to identify the network card and load the corresponding module. If automatic detection fails, you can manually select the module to load. If no module works, it is possible to load a specific module from a removable device. This last solution is usually only needed if the appropriate driver is not included in the standard Linux kernel, but available elsewhere, such as the manufacturer's website.
			</p>
			 <p>
				This step must absolutely be successful for <span class="emphasis"><em>netinst</em></span> installations, since the Debian packages must be loaded from the network.

			 <a id="id-1.7.12.9.3" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <p>
				In order to automate the process as much as possible, the installer attempts an automatic network configuration by DHCP (for IPv4) and by IPv6 network discovery. If this fails, it offers more choices: try again with a normal DHCP configuration, attempt DHCP configuration by declaring the name of the machine, or set up a static network configuration.
			</p>
			 <p>
				This last option requires an IP address, a subnet mask, an IP address for a potential gateway, a machine name, and a domain name.
			</p>
			 <div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>TIP</em></span> Configuration without DHCP</strong></p></div></div></div> 
			 <p>
				If the local network is equipped with a DHCP server that you do not wish to use because you prefer to define a static IP address for the machine during installation, you can add the <strong class="userinput"><code>netcfg/use_dhcp=false</code></strong> option when booting from the CD-ROM. You just need to go to the desired menu entry by pressing the <span class="keycap"><strong>TAB</strong></span> key and add the desired option before pressing the <span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span> key.
			</p>
			 </div> <div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>BEWARE</em></span> Do not improvise</strong></p></div></div></div> 
			 <p>
				Many local area networks are based on an implicit assumption that all machines can be trusted, and inadequate configuration of a single computer will often perturb the whole network. As a result, do not connect your machine to a network without first agreeing with its administrator on the appropriate settings (for example, the IP address, netmask, and broadcast address).

			 <a id="id-1.7.12.10.2" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <p>
				The super-user root account, reserved for the machine's administrator, is automatically created during installation; this is why a password is requested. The installer also asks for a confirmation of the password to prevent any input error which would later be difficult to amend.
			</p>
			 <div class="figure" id="id-1.7.12.10.4"><a id="id-1.7.12.10.4"/><p class="title"><strong>Hình 4.5. Administrator Password</strong></p><div class="figure-contents">

			</div></div>
			 <div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>SECURITY</em></span> Administrator password</strong></p></div></div></div> 
			 <p>
				The root user's password should be long (8 characters or more) and impossible to guess. Indeed, any computer (and a fortiori any server) connected to the Internet is regularly targeted by automated connection attempts with the most obvious passwords. Sometimes it may even be subject to dictionary attacks, in which many combinations of words and numbers are tested as password. Avoid using the names of children or parents, dates of birth, etc.: many of your co-workers might know them, and you rarely want to give them free access to the computer in question.
			</p>
			 <p>
				These remarks are equally applicable for other user passwords, but the consequences of a compromised account are less drastic for users without administrative rights.
			</p>
			 <p>
				If inspiration is lacking, do not hesitate to use password generators, such as <span class="command"><strong>pwgen</strong></span> (in the package of the same name).

			 <p>
				Debian also imposes the creation of a standard user account so that the administrator doesn't get into the bad habit of working as root. The precautionary principle essentially means that each task is performed with the minimum required rights, in order to limit the damage caused by human error. This is why the installer will ask for the complete name of this first user, their username, and their password (twice, to prevent the risk of erroneous input).

			 <p>
				If the network is available, the system's internal clock is updated (in a one-shot way) from an NTP server. This way the timestamps on logs will be correct from the first boot. For them to remain consistently precise over time, an NTP daemon needs to be set up after initial installation (see <a class="xref" href="sect.config-misc.html#sect.time-synchronization" title="8.9.2. Time Synchronization">Phần 8.9.2, “Time Synchronization”</a>).

			 <a id="id-1.7.12.14.2" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>CULTURE</em></span> Uses of partitioning</strong></p></div></div></div> 
			 <p>
				Partitioning, an indispensable step in installation, consists in dividing the available space on the hard drives (each subdivision thereof being called a “partition”) according to the data to be stored on it and the use for which the computer is intended. This step also includes choosing the filesystems to be used. All of these decisions will have an influence on performance, data security, and the administration of the server.
			</p>
			 </div> <p>
				The partitioning step is traditionally difficult for new users. It is necessary to define the various portions of the disks (or “partitions”) on which the Linux filesystems and virtual memory (swap) will be stored. This task is complicated if another operating system that you want to keep is already on the machine. Indeed, you will then have to make sure that you do not alter its partitions (or that you resize them without causing damage).
			</p>
			 <p>
				Fortunately, the partitioning software has a “guided” mode which recommends partitions for the user to make — in most cases, you can simply validate the software's suggestions.
			</p>
			 <div class="figure" id="id-1.7.12.14.6"><a id="id-1.7.12.14.6"/><p class="title"><strong>Hình 4.7. Choice of partitioning mode</strong></p><div class="figure-contents">
				
				 <div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/inst-partman.png" alt="Choice of partitioning mode"/></div>

			</div></div>
			 <p>
				The first screen in the partitioning tool offers the choice of using an entire hard drive to create various partitions. For a (new) computer which will solely use Linux, this option is clearly the simplest, and you can choose the option “Guided - use entire disk”. If the computer has two hard drives for two operating systems, setting one drive for each is also a solution that can facilitate partitioning. In both of these cases, the next screen offers to choose the disk where Linux will be installed by selecting the corresponding entry (for example, “SCSI1 (0,0,0) (sda) - 12.9 GB ATA VBOX HARDDISK”). You then start guided partitioning.
			</p>
			 <div class="figure" id="id-1.7.12.14.8"><a id="id-1.7.12.14.8"/><p class="title"><strong>Hình 4.8. Disk to use for guided partitioning</strong></p><div class="figure-contents">
				
				 <div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/inst-partman-disk.png" alt="Disk to use for guided partitioning"/></div>

			</div></div>
			 <p>
				Guided partitioning can also set up LVM logical volumes instead of partitions (see below). Since the remainder of the operation is the same, we will not go over the option “Guided - use entire disk and set up LVM” (encrypted or not).
			</p>
			 <p>
				In other cases, when Linux must work alongside other already existing partitions, you need to choose manual partitioning.
			</p>
			 <section class="section" id="sect.install-autopartman-mode"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a xmlns="" id="sect.install-autopartman-mode"/>4.2.13.1. Guided partitioning</h4></div></div></div>
				
				 <a id="id-1.7.12.14.11.2" class="indexterm"></a>
				 <p>
					The guided partitioning tool offers three partitioning methods, which correspond to different usages.
				</p>
				 <div class="figure" id="id-1.7.12.14.11.4"><a id="id-1.7.12.14.11.4"/><p class="title"><strong>Hình 4.9. Guided partitioning</strong></p><div class="figure-contents">
					
					 <div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/inst-autopartman-mode.png" alt="Guided partitioning"/></div>

				</div></div>
				 <p>
					The first method is called “All files in one partition”. The entire Linux system tree is stored in a single filesystem, corresponding to the root <code class="filename">/</code> directory. This simple and robust partitioning fits perfectly for personal or single-user systems. In fact, two partitions will be created: the first will house the complete system, the second the virtual memory (swap).
				</p>
				 <p>
					The second method, “Separate <code class="filename">/home/</code> partition”, is similar, but splits the file hierarchy in two: one partition contains the Linux system (<code class="filename">/</code>), and the second contains “home directories” (meaning user data, in files and subdirectories available under <code class="filename">/home/</code>).
				</p>
				 <p>
					The last partitioning method, called “Separate <code class="filename">/home</code>, <code class="filename">/var</code>, and <code class="filename">/tmp</code> partitions”, is appropriate for servers and multi-user systems. It divides the file tree into many partitions: in addition to the root (<code class="filename">/</code>) and user accounts (<code class="filename">/home/</code>) partitions, it also has partitions for server software data (<code class="filename">/var/</code>), and temporary files (<code class="filename">/tmp/</code>). These divisions have several advantages. Users can not lock up the server by consuming all available hard drive space (they can only fill up <code class="filename">/tmp/</code> and <code class="filename">/home/</code>). The daemon data (especially logs) can no longer clog up the rest of the system.
				</p>

				 <a id="id-1.7.12.14.11.8.3" class="indexterm"></a>
				 <p>
					A filesystem defines the way in which data is organized on the hard drive. Each existing filesystem has its merits and limitations. Some are more robust, others more effective: if you know your needs well, choosing the most appropriate filesystem is possible. Various comparisons have already been made; it seems that ReiserFS is particularly efficient for reading many small files; <span class="emphasis"><em>XFS</em></span>, in turn, works faster with large files. <span class="emphasis"><em>Ext4</em></span>, the default filesystem for Debian, is a good compromise, based on the three previous versions of filesystems historically used in Linux (<span class="emphasis"><em>ext</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>ext2</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>ext3</em></span>). <span class="emphasis"><em>Ext4</em></span> overcomes certain limitations of <span class="emphasis"><em>ext3</em></span> and is particularly appropriate for very large capacity hard drives. Another option would be to experiment with the very promising <span class="emphasis"><em>btrfs</em></span>, which includes numerous features that require, to this day, the use of LVM and/or RAID.
				</p>
				 <p>
					A journalized filesystem (such as <span class="emphasis"><em>ext3</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>ext4</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>btrfs</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>reiserfs</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>xfs</em></span>) takes special measures to make it possible to return to a prior consistent state after an abrupt interruption without completely analyzing the entire disk (as was the case with the <span class="emphasis"><em>ext2</em></span> system). This functionality is carried out by filling in a journal that describes the operations to conduct prior to actually executing them. If an operation is interrupted, it will be possible to “replay” it from the journal. Conversely, if an interruption occurs during an update of the journal, the last requested change is simply ignored; the data being written could be lost, but since the data on the disk has not changed, they have remained coherent. This is nothing more nor less than a transactional mechanism applied to the filesystem.
				</p>
				 </div> <p>
					After choosing the type of partition, the software calculates a suggestion, and describes it on the screen; the user can then modify it if needed. You can, in particular, choose another filesystem if the standard choice (<span class="emphasis"><em>ext4</em></span>) isn't appropriate. In most cases, however, the proposed partitioning is reasonable and it can be accepted by selecting the “Finish partitioning and write changes to disk” entry.

				 <p>
					To install Debian alongside an existing operating system (Windows or other), you must have some available hard drive space that is not being used by the other system in order to be able to create the partitions dedicated to Debian. In most cases, this means shrinking a Windows partition and reusing the freed space.
				</p>
				 <p>
					The Debian installer allows this operation when using the manual mode for partitioning. You only need to choose the Windows partition and enter its new size (this works the same with both FAT and NTFS partitions).
				</p>
				 </div> <p>
					The first screen displays the available disks, their partitions, and any possible free space that has not yet been partitioned. You can select each displayed element; pressing the <span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span> key then gives a list of possible actions.
				</p>
				 <p>
					You can erase all partitions on a disk by selecting it.
				</p>
				 <p>
					When selecting free space on a disk, you can manually create a new partition. You can also do this with guided partitioning, which is an interesting solution for a disk that already contains another operating system, but which you may wish to partition for Linux in a standard manner. See <a class="xref" href="sect.installation-steps.html#sect.install-autopartman-mode" title="4.2.13.1. Guided partitioning">Phần 4.2.13.1, “Guided partitioning”</a> for more details on guided partitioning.

					The mount point is the directory tree that will house the contents of the filesystem on the selected partition. Thus, a partition mounted at <code class="filename">/home/</code> is traditionally intended to contain user data.
				</p>
				 <p>

					Virtual memory allows the Linux kernel, when lacking sufficient memory (RAM), to free a bit of storage by storing the parts of the RAM that have been inactive for some time on the swap partition of the hard disk.
				</p>
				 <p>
					To simulate the additional memory, Windows uses a swap file that is directly contained in a filesystem. Conversely, Linux uses a partition dedicated to this purpose, hence the term “swap partition”.

				 <p>
					Some types of RAID allow the duplication of information stored on hard drives to prevent data loss in the event of a hardware problem affecting one of them. Level 1 RAID keeps a simple, identical copy (mirror) of a hard drive on another drive, while level 5 RAID splits redundant data over several disks, thus allowing the complete reconstruction of a failing drive.
				</p>
				 <p>
					We will only describe level 1 RAID, which is the simplest to implement. The first step involves creating two partitions of identical size located on two different hard drives, and to label them “physical volume for RAID”.
				</p>
				 <p>
					You must then choose “Configure software RAID” in the partitioning tool to combine these two partitions into a new virtual disk and select “Create MD device” in the configuration screen. You then need to answer a series of questions about this new device. The first question asks about the RAID level to use, which in our case will be “RAID1”. The second question asks about the number of active devices — two in our case, which is the number of partitions that need to be included in this MD device. The third question is about the number of spare devices — 0; we have not planned any additional disk to take over for a possible defective disk. The last question requires you to choose the partitions for the RAID device — these would be the two that we have set aside for this purpose (make sure you only select the partitions that explicitly mention “raid”).
				</p>
				 <p>
					Back to the main menu, a new virtual “RAID” disk appears. This disk is presented with a single partition which can not be deleted, but whose use we can choose (just like for any other partition).
				</p>
				 <p>
					For further details on RAID functions, please refer to <a class="xref" href="advanced-administration.html#sect.raid-soft" title="12.1.1. Software RAID">Phần 12.1.1, “Software RAID”</a>.

			 <section class="section" id="sect.install-lvm"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a xmlns="" id="sect.install-lvm"/>4.2.13.4. Configuring the Logical Volume Manager (LVM)</h4></div></div></div>
				
				 <a id="id-1.7.12.14.14.2" class="indexterm"></a>
				 <a id="id-1.7.12.14.14.3" class="indexterm"></a>
				 <p>
					LVM allows you to create “virtual” partitions that span over several disks. The benefits are twofold: the size of the partitions are no longer limited by individual disks but by their cumulative volume, and you can resize existing partitions at any time, possibly after adding an additional disk when needed.
				</p>
				 <p>
					LVM uses a particular terminology: a virtual partition is a “logical volume”, which is part of a “volume group”, or an association of several “physical volumes”. Each of these terms in fact corresponds to a “real” partition (or a software RAID device).
				</p>
				 <a id="id-1.7.12.14.14.6" class="indexterm"></a>
				 <a id="id-1.7.12.14.14.7" class="indexterm"></a>
				 <a id="id-1.7.12.14.14.8" class="indexterm"></a>
				 <a id="id-1.7.12.14.14.9" class="indexterm"></a>
				 <p>
					This technique works in a very simple way: each volume, whether physical or logical, is split into blocks of the same size, which are made to correspond by LVM. The addition of a new disk will cause the creation of a new physical volume, and these new blocks can be associated to any volume group. All of the partitions in the volume group that is thus expanded will have additional space into which they can extend.
				</p>
				 <p>
					The partitioning tool configures LVM in several steps. First you must create on the existing disks the partitions that will be “physical volumes for LVM”. To activate LVM, you need to choose “Configure the Logical Volume Manager (LVM)”, then on the same configuration screen “Create a volume group”, to which you will associate the existing physical volumes. Finally, you can create logical volumes within this volume group. Note that the automatic partitioning system can perform all these steps automatically.
				</p>
				 <p>
					In the partitioning menu, each physical volume will appear as a disk with a single partition which can not be deleted, but that you can use as desired.
				</p>
				 <p>
					The usage of LVM is described in further detail in <a class="xref" href="advanced-administration.html#sect.lvm" title="12.1.2. LVM">Phần 12.1.2, “LVM”</a>.

				 <p>
					To guarantee the confidentiality of your data, for instance in the event of the loss or theft of your computer or a hard drive, it is possible to encrypt the data on some partitions. This feature can be added underneath any filesystem, since, as for LVM, Linux (and more particularly the dm-crypt driver) uses the Device Mapper to create a virtual partition (whose content is protected) based on an underlying partition that will store the data in an encrypted form (thanks to LUKS, Linux Unified Key Setup, a standard format that enables the storage of encrypted data as well as meta-information that indicates the encryption algorithms used).
				</p>
				 <div class="sidebar" id="sidebar.encrypted-swap-partition"><a xmlns="" id="sidebar.encrypted-swap-partition"/><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>SECURITY</em></span> Encrypted swap partition</strong></p></div></div></div> 
				 <p>
					When an encrypted partition is used, the encryption key is stored in memory (RAM). Since retrieving this key allows the decryption of the data, it is of utmost importance to avoid leaving a copy of this key that would be accessible to the possible thief of the computer or hard drive, or to a maintenance technician. This is however something that can easily occur with a laptop, since when hibernating the contents of RAM is stored on the swap partition. If this partition isn't encrypted, the thief may access the key and use it to decrypt the data from the encrypted partitions. This is why, when you use encrypted partitions, it is imperative to also encrypt the swap partition!
				</p>
				 <p>
					The Debian installer will warn the user if they try to make an encrypted partition while the swap partition isn't encrypted.
				</p>
				 </div> <p>
					To create an encrypted partition, you must first assign an available partition for this purpose. To do so, select a partition and indicate that it is to be used as a “physical volume for encryption”. After partitioning the disk containing the physical volume to be made, choose “Configure encrypted volumes”. The software will then propose to initialize the physical volume with random data (making the localization of the real data more difficult), and will ask you to enter an “encryption passphrase”, which you will have to enter every time you boot your computer in order to access the content of the encrypted partition. Once this step has been completed, and you have returned to the partitioning tool menu, a new partition will be available in an “encrypted volume”, which you can then configure just like any other partition. In most cases, this partition is used as a physical volume for LVM so as to protect several partitions (LVM logical volumes) with the same encryption key, including the swap partition (see sidebar <a class="xref" href="sect.installation-steps.html#sidebar.encrypted-swap-partition" title="SECURITY Encrypted swap partition"><span class="emphasis"><em>SECURITY</em></span> Encrypted swap partition</a>).

			 <a id="id-1.7.12.15.2" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <p>
				This step, which doesn't require any user interaction, installs the Debian “base system” packages. This includes the <span class="command"><strong>dpkg</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>apt</strong></span> tools, which manage Debian packages, as well as the utilities necessary to boot the system and start using it.

			 <a id="id-1.7.12.16.3" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <p>
				In order to be able to install additional software, APT needs to be configured and told where to find Debian packages. This step is as automated as possible. It starts with a question asking if it must use a network source for packages, or if it should only look for packages on the CD-ROM.
			</p>
			 <div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>NOTE</em></span> Debian CD-ROM in the drive</strong></p></div></div></div> 
			 <p>
				If the installer detects a Debian installation disk in the CD/DVD reader, it is not necessary to configure APT to go looking for packages on the network: APT is automatically configured to read packages from a removable media drive. If the disk is part of a set, the software will offer to “explore” other disks in order to reference all of the packages stored on them.
			</p>
			 </div> <p>
				If getting packages from the network is requested, the next two questions allow to choose a server from which to download these packages, by choosing first a country, then a mirror available in that country (a mirror is a public server hosting copies of all the files of the Debian master archive).
			</p>
			 <div class="figure" id="id-1.7.12.16.7"><a id="id-1.7.12.16.7"/><p class="title"><strong>Hình 4.12. Selecting a Debian mirror</strong></p><div class="figure-contents">
				
				 <div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/inst-mirror.png" alt="Selecting a Debian mirror"/></div>

			</div></div>
			 <p>
				Finally, the program proposes to use an HTTP proxy. If there is no proxy, Internet access will be direct. If you type <code class="literal">http://proxy.falcot.com:3128</code>, APT will use the Falcot <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">proxy/cache</em></span>, a “Squid” program. You can find these settings by checking the configurations of a web browser on another machine connected to the same network.
			</p>
			 <p>
				The files <code class="filename">Packages.gz</code> and <code class="filename">Sources.gz</code> are then automatically downloaded to update the list of packages recognized by APT.
			</p>
			 <div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>BACK TO BASICS</em></span> HTTP proxy</strong></p></div></div></div>

			 <p>
				An HTTP proxy is a server that forwards an HTTP request for network users. It sometimes helps to speed up downloads by keeping a copy of files that have been transferred through it (we then speak of proxy/cache). In some cases, it is the only means of accessing an external web server; in such cases it is essential to answer the corresponding question during installation for the program to be able to download the Debian packages through it.
			</p>
			 <p>
				Squid is the name of the server software used by Falcot Corp to offer this service.

				The Debian system contains a package called <span class="pkg pkg">popularity-contest</span>, whose purpose is to compile package usage statistics. Each week, this program collects information on the packages installed and those used recently, and anonymously sends this information to the Debian project servers. The project can then use this information to determine the relative importance of each package, which influences the priority that will be granted to them. In particular, the most “popular” packages will be included in the installation CD-ROM, which will facilitate their access for users who do not wish to download them or to purchase a complete set.

				The following step allows you to choose the purpose of the machine in very broad terms; the ten suggested tasks correspond to lists of packages to be installed. The list of the packages that will actually be installed will be fine-tuned and completed later on, but this provides a good starting point in a simple manner.

				The bootloader is the first program started by the BIOS. This program loads the Linux kernel into memory and then executes it. It often offers a menu that allows the user to choose the kernel to load and/or the operating system to boot.
			</p>
			 <div class="sidebar" id="sidebar.bootloader-dual-boot"><a xmlns="" id="sidebar.bootloader-dual-boot"/><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>BEWARE</em></span> Bootloader and dual boot</strong></p></div></div></div> 
			 <a id="id-1.7.12.19.6.2" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <p>
				This phase in the Debian installation process detects the operating systems that are already installed on the computer, and automatically adds corresponding entries in the boot menu, but not all installation programs do this.
			</p>
			 <p>
				In particular, if you install (or reinstall) Windows thereafter, the bootloader will be erased. Debian will still be on the hard drive, but will no longer be accessible from the boot menu. You would then have to boot the Debian installation system in <strong class="userinput"><code>rescue</code></strong> mode to set up a less exclusive bootloader. This operation is described in detail in the installation manual. <a class="ulink" href="http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/ch08s07.html">http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/ch08s07.html</a>
			</p>
			 </div> <p>
				By default, the menu proposed by GRUB contains all the installed Linux kernels, as well as any other operating systems that were detected. This is why you should accept the offer to install it in the Master Boot Record. Since keeping older kernel versions preserves the ability to boot the same system if the most recently installed kernel is defective or poorly adapted to the hardware, it often makes sense to keep a few older kernel versions installed.
			</p>
			 <p>
				GRUB is the default bootloader installed by Debian thanks to its technical superiority: it works with most filesystems and therefore doesn't require an update after each installation of a new kernel, since it reads its configuration during boot and finds the exact position of the new kernel. Version 1 of GRUB (now known as “Grub Legacy”) couldn't handle all combinations of LVM and software RAID; version 2, installed by default, is more complete. There may still be situations where it is more recommendable to install LILO (another bootloader); the installer will suggest it automatically.
			</p>
			 <p>
				For more information on configuring GRUB, please refer to <a class="xref" href="sect.config-bootloader.html#sect.config-grub" title="8.8.3. GRUB 2 Configuration">Phần 8.8.3, “GRUB 2 Configuration”</a>.
