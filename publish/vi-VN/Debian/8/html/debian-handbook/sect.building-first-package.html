			 <p>
				Fake packages and meta-packages are similar, in that they are empty shells that only exist for the effects their meta-data have on the package handling stack.
			</p>
			 <p>
				The purpose of a fake package is to trick <span class="command"><strong>dpkg</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>apt</strong></span> into believing that some package is installed even though it's only an empty shell. This allows satisfying dependencies on a package when the corresponding software was installed outside the scope of the packaging system. Such a method works, but it should still be avoided whenever possible, since there is no guarantee that the manually installed software behaves exactly like the corresponding package would and other packages depending on it would not work properly.
			</p>
			 <p>
				On the other hand, a meta-package exists mostly as a collection of dependencies, so that installing the meta-package will actually bring in a set of other packages in a single step.
			</p>
			 <p>
				Both these kinds of packages can be created by the <span class="command"><strong>equivs-control</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>equivs-build</strong></span> commands (in the <span class="pkg pkg">equivs</span> package). The <span class="command"><strong>equivs-control <em class="replaceable">file</em></strong></span> command creates a Debian package header file that should be edited to contain the name of the expected package, its version number, the name of the maintainer, its dependencies, and its description. Other fields without a default value are optional and can be deleted. The <code class="literal">Copyright</code>, <code class="literal">Changelog</code>, <code class="literal">Readme</code> and <code class="literal">Extra-Files</code> fields are not standard fields in Debian packages; they only make sense within the scope of <span class="command"><strong>equivs-build</strong></span>, and they will not be kept in the headers of the generated package.

				The next step is to generate the Debian package with the <span class="command"><strong>equivs-build <em class="replaceable">file</em></strong></span> command. Voilà: the package is created in the current directory and it can be handled like any other Debian package would.

			 <p>
				The Falcot Corp administrators need to create a Debian package in order to ease deployment of a set of documents on a large number of machines. The administrator in charge of this task first reads the “New Maintainer's Guide”, then starts working on their first package. <a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/">https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/</a>
			</p>
			 <p>
				The first step is creating a <code class="filename">falcot-data-1.0</code> directory to contain the target source package. The package will logically, be named <code class="literal">falcot-data</code> and bear the <code class="literal">1.0</code> version number. The administrator then places the document files in a <code class="filename">data</code> subdirectory. Then they invoke the <span class="command"><strong>dh_make</strong></span> command (from the <span class="pkg pkg">dh-make</span> package) to add files required by the package generation process, which will all be stored in a <code class="filename">debian</code> subdirectory:
			</p>
			 
<pre class="screen">
<code class="computeroutput">$ </code><strong class="userinput"><code>cd falcot-data-1.0</code></strong>
<code class="computeroutput">$ </code><strong class="userinput"><code>dh_make --native</code></strong>
<code class="computeroutput"> Type of package: single binary, indep binary, multiple binary, library, kernel module, kernel patch? [s/i/m/l/k/n] </code><strong class="userinput"><code>i</code></strong>
<code class="computeroutput"> Maintainer name : Raphael Hertzog Email-Address : hertzog@debian.org Date : Fri, 04 Sep 2015 12:09:39 -0400 Package Name : falcot-data Version : 1.0 License : gpl3 Type of Package : Independent Hit &lt;enter&gt; to confirm: Currently there is no top level Makefile. This may require additional tuning. Done. Please edit the files in the debian/ subdirectory now. You should also check that the falcot-data Makefiles install into $DESTDIR and not in / . $</code></pre>
			 <p>
				The selected type of package (<span class="emphasis"><em>indep binary</em></span>) indicates that this source package will generate a single binary package that can be shared across all architectures (<code class="literal">Architecture: all</code>). <span class="emphasis"><em>single binary</em></span> acts as a counterpart, and leads to a single binary package that is dependent on the target architecture (<code class="literal">Architecture: any</code>). In this case, the former choice is more relevant since the package only contains documents and no binary programs, so it can be used similarly on computers of all architectures.
			</p>
			 <a id="id-1.18.5.3.6" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <a id="id-1.18.5.3.7" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <p>
				The <span class="emphasis"><em>multiple binary</em></span> type corresponds to a source package leading to several binary packages. A particular case, <span class="emphasis"><em>library</em></span>, is useful for shared libraries, since they need to follow strict packaging rules. In a similar fashion, <span class="emphasis"><em>kernel module</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>kernel patch</em></span> should be restricted to packages containing kernel modules.
			</p>
			 <div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong><span class="emphasis"><em>TIP</em></span> Maintainer's name and email address</strong></p></div></div></div> 
			 <p>
				Most of the programs involved in package maintenance will look for your name and email address in the <code class="varname">DEBFULLNAME</code> and <code class="varname">DEBEMAIL</code> or <code class="varname">EMAIL</code> environment variables. Defining them once and for all will avoid you having to type them multiple times. If your usual shell is <span class="command"><strong>bash</strong></span>, it is a simple matter of adding the following two lines in your <code class="filename">~/.bashrc</code> file (you will obviously replace the values with more relevant ones!):
			</p>
			 
<pre class="programlisting">
export EMAIL="hertzog@debian.org"
export DEBFULLNAME="Raphael Hertzog"
</pre>
			 </div> <p>
				The <span class="command"><strong>dh_make</strong></span> command created a <code class="filename">debian</code> subdirectory with many files. Some are required, in particular <code class="filename">rules</code>, <code class="filename">control</code>, <code class="filename">changelog</code> and <code class="filename">copyright</code>. Files with the <code class="filename">.ex</code> extension are example files that can be used by modifying them (and removing the extension) when appropriate. When they are not needed, removing them is recommended. The <code class="filename">compat</code> file should be kept, since it is required for the correct functioning of the <span class="emphasis"><em>debhelper</em></span> suite of programs (all beginning with the <span class="command"><strong>dh_</strong></span> prefix) used at various stages of the package build process.
			</p>
			 <p>
				The <code class="filename">copyright</code> file must contain information about the authors of the documents included in the package, and the related license. In our case, these are internal documents and their use is restricted to within the Falcot Corp company. The default <code class="filename">changelog</code> file is generally appropriate; replacing the “Initial release” with a more verbose explanation and changing the distribution from <code class="literal">unstable</code> to <code class="literal">internal</code> is enough. The <code class="filename">control</code> file was also updated: the <code class="literal">Section</code> field has been changed to <span class="emphasis"><em>misc</em></span> and the <code class="literal">Homepage</code>, <code class="literal">Vcs-Git</code> and <code class="literal">Vcs-Browser</code> fields were removed. The <code class="literal">Depends</code> fields was completed with <code class="literal">iceweasel | www-browser</code> so as to ensure the availability of a web browser able to display the documents in the package.

			 <a id="id-1.18.5.3.15.2" class="indexterm"></a>
			 <p>
				A <code class="filename">Makefile</code> file is a script used by the <span class="command"><strong>make</strong></span> program; it describes rules for how to build a set of files from each other in a tree of dependencies (for instance, a program can be built from a set of source files). The <code class="filename">Makefile</code> file describes these rules in the following format:
			</p>
			 
<pre class="programlisting">
target: source1 source2 ...
        command1
        command2
</pre>
			 <p>
				The interpretation of such a rule is as follows: if one of the <code class="literal">source*</code> files is more recent than the <code class="literal">target</code> file, then the target needs to be generated, using <span class="command"><strong>command1</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>command2</strong></span>.
			</p>
			 <p>
				Note that the command lines must start with a tab character; also note that when a command line starts with a dash character (<code class="literal">-</code>), failure of the command does not interrupt the whole process.
			</p>
			 </div> <p>
				The <code class="filename">rules</code> file usually contains a set of rules used to configure, build and install the software in a dedicated subdirectory (named after the generated binary package). The contents of this subdirectory is then archived within the Debian package as if it were the root of the filesystem. In our case, files will be installed in the <code class="filename">debian/falcot-data/usr/share/falcot-data/</code> subdirectory, so that installing the generated package will deploy the files under <code class="filename">/usr/share/falcot-data/</code>. The <code class="filename">rules</code> file is used as a <code class="filename">Makefile</code>, with a few standard targets (including <code class="literal">clean</code> and <code class="literal">binary</code>, used respectively to clean the source directory and generate the binary package).
			</p>
			 <p>
				Although this file is the heart of the process, it increasingly contains only the bare minimum for running a standard set of commands provided by the <span class="command"><strong>debhelper</strong></span> tool. Such is the case for files generated by <span class="command"><strong>dh_make</strong></span>. To install our files, we simply configure the behavior of the <span class="command"><strong>dh_install</strong></span> command by creating the following <code class="filename">debian/falcot-data.install</code> file:
			</p>
			 
<pre class="programlisting">
data/* usr/share/falcot-data/
</pre>
			 <p>
				At this point, the package can be created. We will however add a lick of paint. Since the administrators want the documents to be easily accessed from the menus of graphical desktop environments, we add a <code class="filename">falcot-data.desktop</code> file and get it installed in <code class="filename">/usr/share/applications</code> by adding a second line to <code class="filename">debian/falcot-data.install</code>.
			</p>
			 <div class="example" id="id-1.18.5.3.20"><a xmlns="" id="id-1.18.5.3.20"/><p class="title"><strong>Ví dụ 15.6. The <code class="filename">falcot-data.desktop</code> file</strong></p><div class="example-contents">

			</div></div>
			 <p>
				The updated <code class="filename">debian/falcot-data.install</code> looks like this:
			</p>
			 
<pre class="programlisting">
data/* usr/share/falcot-data/
falcot-data.desktop usr/share/applications/
</pre>
			 <p>
				Our source package is now ready. All that's left to do is to generate the binary package, with the same method we used previously for rebuilding packages: we run the <span class="command"><strong>dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc</strong></span> command from within the <code class="filename">falcot-data-1.0</code> directory.
