			This book has its origins in French publisher Eyrolles' “Administrator's Handbook” collection, and keeps the same approach of revolving around a case study providing both support and illustration for all topics being addressed.

			<span class="strong strong"><strong>Chapter 1</strong></span> focuses on a non-technical presentation of the Debian project and describes its goals and organization. These aspects are important because they define a general framework that other chapters will complete with more concrete information.
		</p>
		 <p>
			<span class="strong strong"><strong>Chapters 2 and 3</strong></span> provide a broad outline of the case study. At this point, novice readers can take the time to read <span class="strong strong"><strong>appendix B</strong></span>, where they will find a short remedial course explaining a number of basic computing notions, as well as concepts inherent to any Unix system.
		</p>
		 <p>
			To get on with our real subject matter, we will quite naturally start with the installation process (<span class="strong strong"><strong>chapter 4</strong></span>); <span class="strong strong"><strong>chapters 5 and 6</strong></span> will unveil basic tools that any Debian administrator will use, such as those of the <span class="strong strong"><strong>APT</strong></span> family, which is largely responsible for the distribution's excellent reputation. These chapters are in no way restricted to professionals, since everyone is their own administrator at home.
		</p>
		 <p>
			<span class="strong strong"><strong>Chapter 7</strong></span> will be an important parenthesis; it describes workflows to efficiently use documentation and to quickly gain an understanding of problems in order to solve them.
		</p>
		 <p>
			The next chapters will be a more detailed tour of the system, starting with basic infrastructure and services (<span class="strong strong"><strong>chapters 8 to 10</strong></span>) and going progressively up the stack to reach the user applications in <span class="strong strong"><strong>chapter 13</strong></span>. <span class="strong strong"><strong>Chapter 12</strong></span> deals with more advanced subjects that will most directly concern administrators of large sets of computers (including servers), while <span class="strong strong"><strong>chapter 14</strong></span> is a brief introduction to the wider subject of computer security and gives a few keys to avoid most problems.
		</p>
		 <p>
			<span class="strong strong"><strong>Chapter 15</strong></span> is for administrators who want to go further and create their own Debian packages.

			A Debian package is an archive containing all the files required to install a piece of software. It is generally a file with a <code class="filename">.deb</code> extension, and it can be handled with the <span class="command"><strong>dpkg</strong></span> command. Also called a <span class="emphasis"><em>binary package</em></span>, it contains files that can be directly used (such as programs or documentation). On the other hand, a <span class="emphasis"><em>source package</em></span> contains the source code for the software and the instructions required for building the binary package.

			The present version is already the seventh edition of the book (we include the first four that were only available in French). This edition covers version 8 of Debian, code-named <span class="distribution distribution">Jessie</span>. Among the changes, Debian now sports two new architectures — <span class="emphasis"><em>arm64</em></span> for 64-bit ARM processors, and <span class="emphasis"><em>ppc64el</em></span> for little-endian 64-bit PowerPC processors (designed by IBM and licensed to various manufacturers via the OpenPOWER foundation). On the opposite side, some architectures have been dropped (<span class="emphasis"><em>sparc</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>ia64</em></span>) due to lack of volunteers to keep up with development (which itself can be explained by the fact that associated hardware is getting old and less interesting to work on). Some architectures are still available (in the <span class="distribution distribution">Unstable</span> distribution) but did not get their <span class="emphasis"><em>ready for release</em></span> stamp: <span class="emphasis"><em>hurd-i386</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>kfreebsd-i386</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>kfreebsd-amd64</em></span>. All included packages have obviously been updated, including the GNOME desktop, which is now in its version 3.14. More interestingly, there are two new alternative desktops that are available: <a class="ulink" href="http://cinnamon.linuxmint.com/">Cinnamon</a> (fork of GNOME's Shell created by and for Linux Mint) and <a class="ulink" href="http://mate-desktop.org/">MATE</a> (continuation of the GNOME 2.x desktop).

			We have added some notes and remarks in sidebars. They have a variety of roles: they can draw attention to a difficult point, complete a notion of the case study, define some terms, or serve as reminders. Here is a list of the most common of these sidebars:
		</p>
		 <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
				<p>
					BACK TO BASICS: a reminder of some information that is supposed to be known;
				</p>

			</li><li class="listitem">
				<p>
					VOCABULARY: defines a technical term, sometimes Debian specific;
				</p>

			</li><li class="listitem">
				<p>
					COMMUNITY: highlights important persons or roles within the project;
				</p>

			</li><li class="listitem">
				<p>
					POLICY: a rule or recommendation from the Debian Policy. This document is essential within the project, and describes how to package software. The parts of the policy highlighted in this book bring direct benefits to users (for example, knowing that the policy standardizes the location of documentation and examples makes it easy to find them even in a new package).
				</p>

			</li><li class="listitem">
				<p>
					TOOL: presents a relevant tool or service;
				</p>

			</li><li class="listitem">
				<p>
					IN PRACTICE: theory and practice do not always match; these sidebars contain advice resulting from our experience. They can also give detailed and concrete examples;
				</p>

			</li><li class="listitem">
				<p>
					other more or less frequent sidebars are rather explicit: CULTURE, TIP, CAUTION, GOING FURTHER, SECURITY, and so on.
				</p>
